Whether you stumbled upon this blog accidentally, were led here by someone 
who was playing a practical joke, or deliberately came here
in pursuit of knowledge or a solution to a nagging technical problem,
allow me to welcome you and let you know you've come to the right place!

If you're not familiar with [Mobile System 7](http://www.mobilesystem7.com), that's ok.  While 
you're encouraged (by me) to look into how our small team is 
[changing Enterprise Security](http://www.mobilesystem7.com/interlock/), you don't need
to care about Enterprise Software or Security to find this blog interesting or useful - 
and that's the point.  At Mobile System 7 we've benefitted greatly from the open-source 
community and the depth of technical resources available on the Internet, and we'd like to
do our part by sharing the wisdom that our [developers](http://youtu.be/8To-6VIJZRE) have acquired over 
the years - either while building our [Interlock](http://www.mobilesystem7.com/interlock/) 
product, or while serving in many diverse roles at previous companies.

Mobile System 7's development team is comprised of entrepreneurs, startup veterans, and 
former consultants; vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores; [Republicans](https://gop.com/), 
[Democrats](http://www.democrats.org/), and the [politically-indifferent](http://www.justinbiebermusic.com/); 
runners, rock climbers, martial artists, and cyclists; Rubyists, 
Pythonauts, Java & JavaScript nerds (most of us can even explain the difference), 
Haskellites, C/C++ slingers, ActionScripters, Linux geeks, and reluctant C# writers; 
and, without exception, unabashed [Star Wars purists](http://youtu.be/np6vAuS0KNs).  

Another thing we all have in common is that we're opinionated, and, usually to 
**someone's** chagrin, willing to share our opinions.  This is often made 
evident during debates in our internal IRC channel, but when we get down to business
our opinions and passion for sharing them help us find better solutions to 
the many complicated problems we're solving.  Point is - we have a lot to share, we 
want to share it, this blog is where we're going to do it, and we think you just might
benefit from it.  

So what is there to look forward to?  The team will be posting haphazardly in the near future, 
likely as we're inspired, but hopefully more regularly as time marches on.  You 
can expect to see posts along the lines of:

  * Interesting code snippets
  * Libraries we've found useful
  * How we use build tools/toolchains
  * Series of posts explaining how we're approaching certain concepts
  * Details as to how we've integrated with various platforms
  * Development processes that have worked (or have not worked) for us
  * Maybe the occasional recipe or food/beer recommendation

For now, though, we have a couple great posts for you to peruse.  Joseph Turner has some tips about
[improving JRuby/Rails startup time while running on VirtualBox](/blog/post/speeding-up-rails-on-virtualbox/), 
and Chase Courington has shared the details of his experience [migrating from the Rails asset pipeline to
Grunt/Bower/Node](/blog/post/speeding-up-rails-on-virtualbox/).  Check them out, and 
[add us to your feed reader](/feed.xml) so we can drop in on you from time to time.

We're excited to share our knowledge with you!  You may not be excited yet, but I promise you will be....oh, 
[you will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOb3DlB7WA).
