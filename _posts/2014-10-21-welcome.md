We geeks here at [Mobile System 7](http://mobilesystem7.com) are so excited about what we're up to
that we feel obligated to share it with you and the rest of the world.
Though this post isn't a great place to start, you have to start
somewhere, so it may as well be here. In the next couple of weeks, look
for posts on:

  * How we turn a stream of activities into a risk level for your
    identity
  * How we build and manage the awesome that is our front-end
  * Ruby wisdom from our in-house guru
  * Much more!

We're excited. You're probably not excited yet, but you will be. [You
will be.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOb3DlB7WA)
